    REACT - JavaScript Library

        - Angular
        - Ember
        - VUE

    Components
        - Building blocks of React
        - It let yousplit the UI into independent reusable pieces and think about each piece in isolation.
        - Pieces of UI and view logic
        - Classes that know how to render themselves ont HTML

#  Two ways to write Components
    Class Components
        - the traditional REACT component
        - write logic in a JS Class
        - must include a render method

    Function Components
        - historically used for simpler "dumb" components
        - write logic in a JS Class
        - no render method needed, just return content

# Difference between Class Components and Function Components
    - Both can accept props and render contents
    - Historically, function components couldn't use important features like:
        - State
        - Lifecycle Method
    - With the introduction of HOOKS, we can now write full-featured function  components
    - This course covers HooksS
